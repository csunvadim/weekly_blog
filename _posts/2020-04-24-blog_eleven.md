It seems that every single month there is a new technological innovation. 
Whether it is a newer programming language, a cooler smartphone, or a more capable laptop, technology keeps moving forward. 
While all of these might bring a lot of benefit to the table, the most important thing is constitency of the reliability of the product.

For example, lets take a new phone. 
A new phone may be faster, may take better pictures, it may even be able to run applications that other phones could not. 
However, if this same phone would randomly turn-off without any warning, or overheats too easily it would quickly become unsable. 
Because of this, new phones always have to be tested to make sure they are reliably enough.

What if the innovation is a software. 
If this software is capable of doing tasks 10 times as fast surely it seems like it would be worth it for most use cases. 
However,  if this software would finish the task only 90% accurately and another 10% could be processed inaccurately. 
While having a tolerance for errors may be acceptable for some, for most, this new software would quickly lose its appeal regardless of its superior performance.

Not all the new technologies will be better than the old ones, but at some point, a new technology will be better than the old version. 
With countless technological innovations happening all the time, its important to remember that the most important thing is this technology is not only superior, but is just as or more reliable than the old technology.
