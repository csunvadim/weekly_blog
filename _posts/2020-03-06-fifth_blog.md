Computers may have not be around for long, but they quickly became essential at both workplace and home. 
Whether a computer is used for gaming, storage of information, or photoshop, its usage is growing rapidly. 
Naturally, since the usage of computers is so well-spread, the way individuals interact with them is very important. 
Recently, the notion of using wireless tools to interact with computers has been growing more popular, but few actually considered the advantages that wired technlogy has over wireless.

There are many tools for human-to-computer interaction and many of them are now available wireless. 
There are wireless headphones, wireless keyboards, wireless mouse, and even wireless screens now available. 
However, for something to be wireless there needs to be a way for it to communicate to a computer. 
Most of the modern wirless communication is done through Bluetooth, that sends wireless signals in order to communicate. 

Bluetooth however is not a perfect technology, as it still needs power to operate. 
Every Bluetooth powered tool needs to have a battery. 
Previously, tools such as mouse, keyboards, and headphones were powered by the same object that they were sending the signal to, which makes logical sense - if object does not power the accessory then it does not have power, then it does not work, no need to communicate with it. 
Now, to have anything wireless you need to purchase batteries, or charge those devices. 
The fact that devices need to be charged adds to its complexity.

Besides the fact that wireless devices often need to be charged, they are have connection issues. 
Wired computer mouse would always work as long as the wired is plugged in. 
Yet, some wireless computer mouse are having issues working when there are objects in the way, which interfere with the signal. 
Similar applies to wireless headphones, which sometimes have inconsitent music signal which can negatively impact the listening experience. 

In conclusion, while wirless technlogy may seem like the future, it is often more expensive, less convinient, and less reliable than its wired version. 
Before wireless becomes the absolute replacement for wired technologies, it needs some major improvements.
