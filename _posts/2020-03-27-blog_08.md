Entertainment is a giant, diverse, and always growing industry fueled by innovation. 
In past it used to be singing, dancing, story telling, reading and drawing, while all of these are still very popular and relevant, technology allowed for new forms of entertainment to exist. 
Today, most of the entertainment exists through internet.

Television is perhaps still the most used form on entertainment. 
While traditionally it was provided by a connection cable, now with the costs of internet dropping and the starting speeds and reliability improving more and more people are starting to use Internet instead of cable. 
Various telivision companies and streaming services are now capable to provide good quality content with ease through internet. 

Besides telivision, people are also able to read a lot more through the internet. 
If in the past to read a book, a book had to be physically found, bought and well-maintaned, thanks to the internet this process is a lot simpler. 
Most books now have digital copies, which allows people to find books with ease from comforts of their homes. 
Now books that previously would be impossible to find are just a few clicks away.

Internet is improving every single day.
With better internet new forms of entertainment such as AR and VR might be coming shortly.
