Today there is 2 main computer operating systems: Windows, and PC. 
While there are countless other Unix / Linux based systems, those are usually non-standard and require special installations. 
However, a lot of people, especially professionals, when given a choice are willing to pay considerably more than a Macbook than for a PC. 
While both Microsoft and Apple have the most popular laptop operating systems, there is a few major changes between them, which may shine light as to why people are paying more for Macbooks. 

Microsft's Windows started off as an operating system which was installed on computers provided by third party companies such as Dell, HP, Lenovo and others. 
Micrososft only recently started making their own computers. 
However, Apple always sold their own laptops with most of their own components and their own operating systems. 
This much control over their product allowed Apple to better integrate the operating systems and combine hardware with software. 
Due to this, Apple products have always had quality laptops, but with Windows laptops it was a matter of picking the right one out of many potentially poor options. 

When it came to support, Apple also had advantage over Microsoft.  
Not only were Macbooks already more reliable to begin with, Apple had lots of Apple stores that could troubleshoot and help customers fix their laptops. 
The level of support that Apple provided was very important for consumers, especially for professionals who were doing important work on their computers. 
The fact that all computers and operating system were manufactured in one place allowed Apple stores to be the single stop for any issues that a Macbook could have, something that could not be possible with most Windows computers. 

The high standard of quality, the better predicted reliability, and the best supportability is what sets Apple apart. 
While Windows laptops are still more popular due to them having more overall options, Apple laptops have always been considered better products. 
Apple may charge higher premium for their laptops, but in most cases it is well justified.
