While it is preferabble to use default ansible functions for everything, sometimes there can be no default function to accomplish the desired task in ansible.
Using shell in flexible allows for a great amount of flexibility when it comes to designing the workbook.
For things such as copying, there is usually a default ansible function, but if there is no default functionality, you are usually able to get the same results by using shell commands.
Therefore, defining those shell comands in ansible allows for much better usage of ansible.

<b>Copy files in Ansible: </b><br/>
1.) First name your ansible function
2.) Specify the function name as "copy"
3.) Specify "src" as the source of the file you are copying
4.) Specify "dest" as the destination that the file is going to
5.) Add any additional applicable parameters

Example with additional parameter "owner":

- name: Copy file with owner and permissions
  copy:
    src: /srv/myfiles/foo.conf
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
    owner: foo

	
<b>Using shell in ansible to copy a file: /b><br/>
1.) First name your ansible function
2.) Specify the function name as "shell"
3.) Specify the shell command
4.) Add any additional applicable parameters

Example with additional parameter "owner":

- name: Copy file with owner and permissions
  shell: cp /srv/myfiles/foo.conf /etc/foo.conf && chown foo /srv/myfiles/foo.conf

Example of shell with additional arguments:

- name: Change the working directory to somedir/ before executing the command.
  shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt
  args:
    chdir: somedir/
