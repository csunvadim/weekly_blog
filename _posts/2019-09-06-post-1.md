During this weeks assignments I have been succesful in installing, configuring and testing Docker, Jekyll, GitHub (and GitHub Pages).

I was not sure if I was required to install a new theme, but I installed one just in case.
I was having a hard time finding themes compatible with Jekyll 4.0, but plenty for 3.3 / 3.5.
I found it quite a lot easier to "git clone" the theme, and modify it to your liking, then trying to modify the "minima" manually to adopt to different theme's format.
My Jekyll theme of choice was Pixyll.

During the "160 lab A", I have faced a few difficulties on pages 8 - 9 because I was unable to run the "class_setup" command, as I encountered an error which said I lacked necessary permission. 
Eventually I was to notice that there was some sort of a bug during the "useradd" command, and I fixed the issue by re-creating the original user.
