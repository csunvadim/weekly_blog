During week 8 I was primarily working heavily on Group Project 0.

I helped with building the documentation, diagrapms, and I was involved with the creationg and testing of the ansible playbook.

For documentation, I did documentation on VPC, ec2, loadbalancer, Route 53, and a few other topics.
My goal was to cover all the details by breaking them down into simple steps to that were taken.

For diagram, I was advising a teammate on how to properly build a digram and what should be included in each part.

At first ansible playbook gave me a lot of difficulty, as the standard "shell" command syntax that I was using kept giving permission errors.
However, one of my teammates was working in parallel using different syntax choices and he did not encounter this issue, so we were able to build on top of that and build a succesful ansible playbook.
